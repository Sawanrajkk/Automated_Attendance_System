Set Up Requirements: The program starts by loading a face detection model and defining a function, take_attendance, which will handle the process of recording attendance for each student.

File Check: For each day, it checks if an attendance file (like attendance_2024-10-29.csv) exists. If not, it creates one and adds a header row with columns like "Student Name" and "Attendance."

Camera Initialization: It then opens the computer’s camera and tries to capture an image.

Face Detection: The program converts this image to grayscale and uses the face detection model to check if any faces are present in the image. If it detects a face, it assumes the student is present and saves the image with a filename based on the student’s ID and date. If no face is detected, it assumes the student is absent.

Recording Attendance: The program then writes the student’s details (name, ID, date, attendance status, and image location) into the day’s attendance file.

Loop for All Students: This process repeats for all students within a given range of IDs. For each student, the program prompts for the student’s name, captures their attendance, and records it.

Final Summary: After processing all students, the program prints a summary showing the total number of students, along with the counts of those marked as present and absent.
