Set Up Requirements: The program starts by loading a face detection model and defining a function, take_attendance, which will handle the process of recording attendance for each student.
A Cascade Classifier is a type of machine learning model specifically designed for object detection, commonly used to detect faces and other objects in images and video frames

File Check: For each day, it checks if an attendance file (like attendance_2024-10-29.csv) exists. If not, it creates one and adds a header row with columns like "Student Name" and "Attendance."

Camera Initialization: It then opens the computer’s camera and tries to capture an image.

Face Detection: The program converts this image to grayscale and uses the face detection model to check if any faces are present in the image. If it detects a face, it will match the face from the preuploaded image in the file if it is there in the file it mark present and saves the image with a filename based on the student’s ID and date. If no face is detected, it assumes the student is absent.

Recording Attendance: The program then writes the student’s details (name, ID, date, attendance status, and image location) into the day’s attendance file.

Loop for All Students: This process repeats for all students within a given range of IDs. For each student, the program prompts for the student’s name, captures their attendance, and records it.

Final Summary: After processing all students, the program prints a summary showing the total number of students, along with the counts of those marked as present and absent.

# MODULE USED

csv:

This module provides functionality for working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
It is used here to store attendance records in a CSV file, where each row contains details like student name, registration number, date, attendance status, and image location.
datetime:

This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
In this project, it's used to get the current date with datetime.date.today(), which helps in naming the attendance file based on the date and recording the date of attendance in each entry.
cv2 (OpenCV):

OpenCV (imported as cv2) is an open-source library primarily used for computer vision tasks.
In this code, it is used to open the camera, capture images, convert the images to grayscale, and detect faces using the Cascade Classifier model. It also helps save the captured image to a file.
os:

This module provides functions to interact with the operating system.
It’s used here to check if the attendance file for the day already exists (os.path.exists(filename)). If it doesn’t, the code creates a new file to store attendance data.
